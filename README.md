#Lighthouse test
This was a (successful) technical test for a lead Javascript developer position. Requirement:

"There is a basic lighthouse outline in the centre of the screen with rocks and a beam of light. The user will colour the scene by selecting a colour and touching to fill the desired area.  You donâ€™t need to colour every detail of the picture, only a few separate elements."

#WordSorter
Another (successful) technical test for a Java development position. Requirement:

Write a Java application which takes any number of words as command line arguments and outputs unique words (ignoring case) in ascending length and then alphabetical order (where lengths are the same).

The original case should be preserved and the outputted words should be comma separated.

e.g.
java WordSorter Fish DOG banana fish cat a pineapple carrot dog
would produce:
a, cat, DOG, Fish, banana, carrot, pineapple
